      <h1>Lewis' project</h1>
	  <h2>About</h2>
	  <p>The theme for the dataset will be the Mario series of video games and their theme songs/game music. 
	  The Mario series is a video game series developed by Nintendo, and are platformer games 
	  (although there is a number of spin-off series of different video game genres bearing the Mario name). 
	  The Mario games are well-known for their its game music, particularly the theme tunes which have become iconic in popular culture, 
	  and have been subject to different cover versions, remakes, and parodies. 
	  There are ample amounts of descriptive, notated, and acoustic data relating to Mario games’ music – descriptive data 
	  like the composers of the music and the context of which the music appears in the games, 
	  notated data like sheet music and guitar chords, as well as the acoustic data of the original game music 
	  and various cover/derivative versions.</p>
	  <p>There are some manifestations of data related to the music of the Mario games available, for example Discogs pages on Mario 
	  game soundtrack releases (<a href="https://www.discogs.com/Koji-Kondo-Super-Mario/release/6189092">Discogs</a>). 
	  This database provides descriptive data about record releases of the soundtracks of Mario games, whether they be albums or singles, 
	  and also indicates credits for composers and performers on the music. The MuseScore website provides some notation data for Mario music 
	  in the form of sheet music for some of the songs in the series such as the 
	  Super Mario Bros main theme (<a href="https://musescore.com/neoguizmo/scores/2601926">MuseScore</a>). The soundtracks of the game 
	  are available, often in a complete form on the video sharing site YouTube (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgVUipXiqOc">YouTube</a>). 
	  Due to the popularity of Mario game music, music streaming service Spotify also hosts numerous derivative and cover versions 
	  of the music (<a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/05XPxcgHp4I4CFlOhMnskS?si=5zC2rG8oTC6AbphZ8vkTrg">Spotify</a>).</p>
